Project of the Masters of Geodesy and Geoinformatics at the University of Stuttgart

The main idea behind this project is to evaluate the usability of smartphones for a Tsunami Early Warning System.
Displacements of an Earthquake of Magniute 8 are simulated and detected in the data. 

Step 1: Simulate displacements of an earthquake of magnitude 8 with the Okada programme

Step 2: Measure GNSS-data of dynamic movements of smartphone data accoring to simulated action

Step 3: Detect displacement of smartphones within GNSS-Data

Step 4: Calculate earthquakes epicenter from GNSS-Data-Analysis
